/**
 * Agent Control Plane architecture fence.
 *
 * This runs first in `pnpm check`. It is deliberately dependency free and
 * deterministic: it reads the working tree, asks git a few read-only
 * questions, and executes the pre-push hook to prove it still denies.
 *
 * It enforces the P0 laws that a type system cannot:
 *
 *   1. the phase write-set is respected: the exact P0 list plus the exact P1A
 *      additions, and nothing else;
 *   2. docs/ROADMAP.md is still the byte-exact kickoff roadmap;
 *   3. the authority documents still carry their critical literals;
 *   4. the pre-push hook exists, is executable and always refuses;
 *   5. core.hooksPath is actually pointed at .githooks, so the fence is live;
 *   6. no remote is configured;
 *   7. no credential store is present in the repository.
 *
 * P1A adds three more, all of which exist because P1A introduces the first
 * native dependency and the first substantial body of code:
 *
 *   8. the install-time native build allow-list names exactly better-sqlite3;
 *   9. the ledger package depends on exactly what it was authorized to;
 *  10. no file outside the authority documents claims product integration or
 *      cutover authority.
 *
 * P1B adds three more, all of which exist because P1B is the last single-writer
 * phase before three lanes run in parallel:
 *
 *  11. the four new packages depend on exactly what they were authorized to,
 *      and the browser package names no ledger and no database driver anywhere;
 *  12. the retired Vitest workspace file is actually gone, so the deletion is
 *      enforced rather than merely performed once;
 *  13. the lane envelope is scoped to three named prefixes and expires by
 *      itself when the roadmap stops saying P1_INCOMPLETE;
 *  14. no tracked file, lane files included, carries credential material.
 *
 * Every check is read-only. This script never writes, stages or commits.

 * The single exemption, and why it is narrow enough to be one.
 *
 * The contracts test suite proves that findCredentialViolations actually
 * rejects credential shaped values, and the only honest way to prove that is to
 * hand it credential shaped values. A scanner that failed the test asserting
 * the scanner works would force the guard's own evidence to be deleted.
 *
 * The exemption is bounded structurally rather than trusted: an exempt path
 * must be a test file AND must actually call the credential scanner. The check
 * is a call-site regex rather than a substring search: a file that merely names
 * findCredentialViolations in a comment or an import list is not exercising it,
 * and a substring match would let a file keep the exemption by mentioning the
 * function it no longer tests. A production source file can never take this
 * route at all.
