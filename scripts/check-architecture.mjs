/**
 * Agent Control Plane architecture fence.
 *
 * This runs first in `pnpm check`. It is deliberately dependency free and
 * deterministic: it reads the working tree, asks git a few read-only
 * questions, and executes the pre-push hook to prove it still denies.
 *
 * It enforces the P0 laws that a type system cannot:
 *
 *   1. the phase write-set is respected: the exact P0 list plus the exact P1A
 *      additions, and nothing else;
 *   2. docs/ROADMAP.md is still the byte-exact kickoff roadmap;
 *   3. the authority documents still carry their critical literals;
 *   4. the pre-push hook exists, is executable and always refuses;
 *   5. core.hooksPath is actually pointed at .githooks, so the fence is live;
 *   6. no remote is configured;
 *   7. no credential store is present in the repository.
 *
 * P1A adds three more, all of which exist because P1A introduces the first
 * native dependency and the first substantial body of code:
 *
 *   8. the install-time native build allow-list names exactly better-sqlite3;
 *   9. the ledger package depends on exactly what it was authorized to;
 *  10. no file outside the authority documents claims product integration or
 *      cutover authority.
 *
 * Every check is read-only. This script never writes, stages or commits.
